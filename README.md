# 🌿 EverGreen

**EverGreen** is a personal project built with **Vite, React + TypeScript**, and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. The goal is to create a clean, scrollable single-page lawn care website as a way to practice component structuring, layout design, and frontend state management concepts.

> 🧠 This project is still in progress. It's a sandbox for experimenting while learning **Redux** and modern frontend architecture.

## Tech Stack

- ⚡️ Vite (blazing-fast dev server)
- ⚛️ React 18+ with TypeScript
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 📦 Planning to add Redux Toolkit

## Project Goals

- Responsive single-page layout with smooth scroll navigation
- Section-based content (Hero, Services, Contact, etc.)
- State management using Redux for form submission & modal control (coming soon)
- Practice code structuring and reusability
